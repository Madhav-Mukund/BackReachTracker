# BackReachTracker
This is a simple web application built with Flask and MediaPipe that uses your webcam to track how much of your back you can touch with your hand. It captures a still image of your back, allows you to define a rectangular area, and then tracks hand movements to calculate and visualize coverage using hand landmark detection.
